      <h1>Mike Foster: a story</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <h3>Whaaaa?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I am a 37 year old man. Soon I will be 38, but for now 37 will have to
          do.
        </li>
        <li>
          I worked in Tech (video games specifically) for the past 14 years
          before quitting my job to level up and do this coding course. No
          pressure, yeah?
        </li>
        <li>
          Massive fan of B-movies and cult cinema. On the side, I make video
          essays and featurettes for blu-ray releases. So far this year I've
          made videos for an Italian rip-off of Halloween, a slasher set on a
          bus tour of Europe, and an obscure witch-themed horror starring Sean
          Connery's best mate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Generally found with a guitar in my hand(s), although I'm not that
          good. I just like playing a lot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cambridge United fan, but I keep that to myself unless somebody
          expresses an interest as I don't want to be one of those football
          bores. Yeah, you know the ones.
        </li>
        <li>
          I once ate 22 Muller Corners in a single day. It remains my greatest
          accomplishment and contribution to this fragile world.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>But what does he know?</h3>
      <p class="title">Anglia Ruskin University (2004-2007)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>BA (Combined Hons) Film Studies and Intercultural Studies</li>
        <p>
          Because I know you'll ask, Intercultural Studies is a combo of
          anthropology, linguistics and history.
        </p>
      </ul>

      <h3>Who employed this man?</h3>
      <p class="title">Frontier Developments (2015-2023)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lead Technical & Customer Support</li>
        <p>
          Worked my way up to lead a support department for an independent video
          game studio. I got to fix peoples' spaceships and keep their zoo
          animals alive for a living.
        </p>
      </ul>

      <p class="title">Jagex (2009-2014)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Copywriter</li>
        <p>
          Need some words for a storefront? A blog post? A newsletter? A video
          script? I was your man.
        </p>
        <li>Senior Player Support Representative</li>
        <p>
          Handled the day to day management of a team helping online multiplayer
          gamers. Well, night to night for the first couple of years.
          Conclusion: I don't think humans are meant to work nights.
        </p>
      </ul>

      <h3>To-Do List</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Don't die</li>
        <li>Complete coding bootcamp</li>
        <li>
          Finish learning Never Going Back Again by Fleetwood Mac on guitar
        </li>
        <li>
          Stop getting so worked up when people say "I'm bias" while meaning
          "I'm biased"
        </li>
        <li>
          Get employed, prioritising job satisfaction and work-life balance
        </li>
      </ul>
